maze - compare runtime:
* single steps
* action post processing (combine many move-east into move-far-east)
* far-directional movement
* streams to handle infinite domains
try different problem: various length corridors, actual maze, a large grid



scanning 
* what happens in this case:  
(adl to support forall)
    (:action scan-all 
        :param (?s)
        :preconditions (controlled ?s)
        :effects (forall (?b) (when (connected ?b ?s)) (scanned ?b)))
