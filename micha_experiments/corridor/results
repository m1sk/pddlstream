corridor with 1000 tiles:
    simple done at 0.53 seconds
    derived done at 252.91 seconds
conclusion: using derived is very expensive

streams:
    incremental stream done at 0.62 seconds
    focused stream done at 67.56 seconds
also the move far-east action is never choosen
it seems that the incremental just calls the planner and is happy with the result
but focused does try to do some other thing
